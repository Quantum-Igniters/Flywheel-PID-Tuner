# Flywheel-PID-Tuner
This OpMode is meant to help rookie teams tune their flywheel PID in a simple, hands-on way. Start by opening FTC Dashboard and selecting this OpMode in the Config menu. Press X to spin the flywheel up and Y to switch between high and low target speeds. Watch the velocity graph on the dashboard and adjust the PIDF values live. Start by tuning F first until the flywheel reaches the target speed, then slowly increase P to make it reach that speed faster without oscillating. D can be added if the velocity graph looks shaky, and I is usually not needed. Use the right trigger to test shooting while the flywheel is running and watch how well it holds speed under load. The goal is a smooth velocity graph with low error and quick recovery after shots.
