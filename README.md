# Flywheel-PID-Tuner
This OpMode helps newer teams tune flywheel PID using FTC Dashboard. Press X to start the flywheel and Y to switch target speeds. Tune F first to reach the target velocity, then add P to improve response without oscillation. Use the trigger to shoot and watch how well the flywheel holds speed.
